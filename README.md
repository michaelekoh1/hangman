# HANGMAN GAME
[Hangman Game](https://hangman-game-2021.herokuapp.com/) - You can view the live game from here.

Hangman is a word guessing game which runs on the Code Institute mock terminal on Heroku. A player tries to guess a word by guessing letters within a certain number of guesses.

## User Experience

### User Stories
1. As a user, I would want to easily start the game.
2. As a user, I should be able to view my scores while am playing the game.
3. As a user, I should be able to exit the game on completion of the game. 
4. The game should be fun to play given the random words (easy and difficult) to guess.
        
## Features

- The user start with 7 lives and a score of 0
- For each valid letter, the user get 10 points
- For each wrong letter, the user losses 5 points
- If the user wins the match, the score is multiply by the amount of lives
    (example, the user won with 20 points and 2 lives, the total score is 40)
## Testing

The project was manually tested by the following ways:
- Tested in the local terminal and on the mock terminal on the deployed site of Heroku.
- Tested the python code through a PEP8 Linter using (http://pep8online.com/) and fixed the errors.

## Deployment

The site was deployed to GitHub pages using the Code Institute mock terminal on Heroku template.
